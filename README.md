# Faith Script Generator with Claude via AWS Bedrock

This Python script uses Amazon Bedrock to access Anthropic's Claude language model.

It generates faith-based, identity-in-Christ themed video scripts â€” directly from my terminal.

**Key features:**
- Uses Claude-v2/v3 model
- Automates script generation with a custom prompt format
- Runs locally with AWS CLI credentials

---

## How to run

1. Configure AWS CLI with your credentials.
2. Run: `python generate_faith_scripts_claude.py`
3. Watch Claude generate powerful faith-based messages.

This project is part of my journey to build automated Christian content creation tools.
